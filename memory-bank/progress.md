## Known Issues

1. **Video Playback**

   - 🐛 Occasional stuttering during transitions on lower-end devices
   - 🐛 Autoplay restrictions on some mobile browsers
   - 🐛 Video loading delays on slower connections

2. **Admin Interface**

   - 🐛 Form validation feedback could be improved
   - 🐛 Asset list performance with many items
   - 🐛 Hotspot positioning precision on different screen sizes

3. **General**
   - 🐛 Error handling could be more descriptive
   - 🐛 Loading states not consistently implemented across components
   - 🐛 Some console warnings from React components

## Blockers and Issues

1. **Configuration Requirements**

   - Environment variables need to be configured (.env file)
   - MongoDB connection needs to be established
   - Storage directory structure must be created properly

2. **Asset Management Limitations**

   - Current system relies on filesystem structure for location management
   - Assets are tied to location-specific folders
   - Filesystem synchronization is required to keep database in sync with files

3. **Potential Technical Challenges**
   - Video loading performance for large files
   - Mobile browser compatibility for video playback
   - Hotspot positioning accuracy across different screen sizes
   - Incremental migration to Tailwind CSS without breaking existing functionality

## Next Milestone Goals

1. **Admin Interface Enhancement**

   - Create new location management admin page
   - Implement CRUD operations for locations
   - Update AdminContext to support location management
   - Improve asset-location relationship via database instead of filesystem

2. **Asset Management Restructuring**

   - Create a simplified upload directory structure
   - Update asset creation and file serving logic
   - Remove filesystem synchronization functionality
   - Reset database and set up locations through admin interface

3. **UI Framework Migration (In Progress)**

   - Continue phased migration to Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
   - Current focus: Admin navigation interface migration
   - Next focus: Asset management interface migration
   - Maintain all existing functionality during migration

4. **Core Experience Enhancement**
   - Complete video player functionality with proper error handling
   - Finalize hotspot interaction model
   - Implement smooth transitions between video sequences
