# Act Mode

## Workflow Overview

Act Mode is focused on executing specific tasks with precision in the Netflix House Aerial Experience project. It follows a structured approach to ensure tasks are completed correctly and documentation is kept up-to-date.

## Process Steps

### 1. Check Memory Bank

Start by reviewing the Memory Bank to understand:
- Project context and architecture
- Current focus and priorities
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Known issues and blockers

### 2. Update Documentation (If Needed)

Based on the review:
- Check if documentation is current and accurate
- Update any outdated information in relevant files
- Add new insights discovered during implementation
- Document any decisions made during the process

### 3. Update Project Rules (If Needed)

If new patterns or conventions emerge:
- Update the appropriate rule files in `.cursor/rules/`
- Ensure rule files follow the YAML front matter format
- Keep rule files concise (â‰¤ 600 tokens)
- Move complex documentation to the Memory Bank

### 4. Execute Task

Implement the requested changes:
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Make atomic, focused changes
- Use appropriate tools (file editing, terminal commands)
- Test changes to ensure they work as expected
- Follow the project's design patterns and coding style

### 5. Document Changes

After completion:
- Update `progress.md` with new achievements
- Update `activeContext.md` if focus has shifted
- Document any new patterns in `systemPatterns.md`
- Record any new technical details in `techContext.md`

### 6. Verify Implementation

Before considering the task complete:
- Confirm all requirements have been met
- Verify code follows project conventions
- Check for any unintended side effects
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date
