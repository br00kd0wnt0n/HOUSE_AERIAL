# Netflix House Aerial Experience - Core Conventions

## Project Structure

- **Client-Server Architecture**
  - `client/`: React frontend
  - `server/`: Express backend
  - `memory-bank/`: Project documentation

## Frontend Structure

- **Components**: Organized in `client/src/components/` by feature/purpose
- **Assets**: Media stored in `client/public/assets/` and `client/src/assets/`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v3.3.0) with Netflix theme, shadcn/ui components

## Backend Structure

- **Controllers**: Business logic in `server/controllers/`
- **Models**: Mongoose schemas in `server/models/`
- **Routes**: API endpoints in `server/routes/`
- **Storage**: Local file storage in `server/storage/uploads/` by type

## Design Patterns

- **State Management**: React Context API for global state
- **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints with Axios
- **Error Handling**: ErrorBoundary for React components, consistent error response format
- **Loading States**: Component-level loading indicators for UX

## File & Asset Management

- Videos organized by type (AERIAL, DiveIn, FloorLevel, etc.)
- Button assets managed with ON/OFF states
- Assets stored locally, referenced with `filePath` and `accessUrl` fields in MongoDB

## Coding Patterns

- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **CSS**: Tailwind utility classes with shadcn/ui components
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns, utility functions in `src/utils/`
- **Class Naming**: `cn()` utility for Tailwind class merging in `src/lib/utils.js` 


**RULE #1: DO NOT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE. JUST ONE TASK AT A TIME.**

**RULE #2: THE HUMAN WILL REVIEW EACH STEP. I WILL ONLY PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP ONCE HUMAN HAS TESTED, REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE CODE.**

**RULE #3: DO NOT REUSE ANY FILES FROM THE OLD EXPERIENCE. CREATE ALL NEW FILES IN A DEDICATED FOLDER.**

**RULE #4: USE BEST SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICES FOR SPLITTING FILES WITH BEST SYSTEM PATTERNS TO DO SO, FILES SHOULD NOT BE LONGER THAN 500 LINES AND CODE SHOULD NEVER BE REPEATED.**
