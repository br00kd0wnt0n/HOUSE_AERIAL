# Plan Mode

## Workflow Overview

Plan Mode is a structured approach to planning and implementing changes to the Netflix House Aerial Experience project. It follows these steps:

1. Read Memory Bank to understand project context
2. Analyze change request against existing codebase
3. Ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding
4. Develop a step-by-step implementation plan
5. Wait for approval before execution
6. Execute the plan with clear progress updates

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Read Memory Bank

Review all core documentation to understand:
- Project goals and structure from `projectbrief.md`
- User experience objectives from `productContext.md`
- Technical constraints from `techContext.md`
- System architecture from `systemPatterns.md`
- Current focus areas from `activeContext.md`
- Progress and blockers from `progress.md`

### 2. Analyze Change Request

- Examine existing code related to requested changes
- Identify affected components and dependencies
- Determine potential impact on other parts of the system
- Check for related issues in the `progress.md` file

### 3. Ask 4-6 Clarifying Questions

Focus on:
- Scope boundaries and priorities
- User experience expectations
- Technical constraints or requirements
- Integration with existing features
- Testing and validation criteria
- Timeline considerations

### 4. Develop Implementation Plan

Create a step-by-step plan that includes:
- Clear, actionable steps in sequence
- Technical approach for implementation
- Files that need to be created or modified
- Potential challenges and mitigations
- Testing approach for validation

### 5. Await Plan Approval

Present the plan and wait for explicit approval before proceeding.

### 6. Execute with Updates

After approval:
- Announce the start of execution
- Implement steps in sequence
- Provide progress updates after completing major steps
- Document changes in Memory Bank when complete
